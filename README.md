## Project Name: Wi-Detect

We are building Wi-Detect, a non-invasive guardian designed specifically for Women’s Safety.
By using the Wi-Fi signals already in the room, our system detects violence, struggles, or falls
in real-time. It ensures safety in sensitive areas where cameras are banned. By studying the
scattering of electromagnetic waves to and from the source, effectively mapping the human
body, we train our model to detect falls and assaults in real time.
